The Pig Game is a simple dice game that can be played with two or more players. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a certain score threshold, 100 points.

Here's how the Pig Game is played:

Setup: Players take turns rolling a single six-sided die.

Gameplay: On a player's turn, they roll the die as many times as they want, adding the number rolled to their current turn total. They can continue rolling and accumulating points, but if they roll a 1, they lose all the points accumulated during that turn, and their turn ends. If a player chooses to stop rolling voluntarily (before rolling a 1), they can "hold" and add the points from that turn to their total score.

Scoring: After each turn, the points from that turn are added to the player's total score.

Winning the Game: The game continues with players taking turns until one player reaches or exceeds the pre-determined winning score threshold, which is 100 points. The first player to reach or exceed this score wins the game.
